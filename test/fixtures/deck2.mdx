Caution: If you plan to link to specific headings
[<`a href="#heading-what-what"`>](#heading-what-what) within your document,

`{: #anchor-name }` syntax. This ensures that when documents are localized,
the anchor will still work, but also ensures that any difference between
Markdown processors are a non-issue.

You can also put an `<h2>` or `<h3>` inside a table header (`<th>`) to force
the table into the table of contents. Inside a table header, `<h2>` and `<h3>`
are styled like regular text, so readers won't be able to tell.
